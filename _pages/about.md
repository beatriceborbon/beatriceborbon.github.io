A writer and researcher based in London, I’m interested in digital and consumer culture. 

I currently work at [YCN](http://www.ycn.org/), a creative consultancy based in London. There I write copy and features for our online channels, and our quarterly print magazine too. 

I’ve interviewed industry experts and academics, as well as startup founders and senior leaders at established organisations. I'm as comfortable putting together pithy posts and short blurbs for our website, as I am writing long-form, in-depth pieces, grounded in extensive research.

Using a combination of qualitative, desk research and data, I’ve also written reports for clients including Converse, adidas, Getty Images, NSPCC and the Guardian.

I've helped a global environmental charity develop a storytelling strategy around a high-profile court case, an iconic footwear brand tap into the London creative scene by seeding products with local influencers, and worked with AB InBev’s innovation arm to launch a digital thought leadership programme, [ZX.YCN](http://zx.ycn.org/).

And I have experience producing video content, and conducting interviews on film.
