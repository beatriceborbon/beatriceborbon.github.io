A writer and researcher living and working in London, I’m interested in digital and consumer culture. 

I currently work at [YCN](http://www.ycn.org/), a creative consultancy based in London. There I write features for our online channels, and our quarterly print magazine too. I’ve interviewed industry experts and academics, as well as founders of innovative startups and senior leaders at established organisations. 

Using a combination of qualitative, desk research and data, I’ve written reports for clients including Converse, adidas, Getty Images, Greenpeace, NSPCC and the Guardian.

And I also have experience in producing video content and conducting interviews for film.
